###  Hi there

My name is Archie and I'm the author of Privacy Quest.

We all know how hard is to start something on the web, but what most people don't know is its hard to keep your personal data off of it. This blog is a combination of the story of my privacy quest and personal musings and thoughts. I hope that it provides informational, educational, or at the very least entertaining.

If you have any ideas for things I should write about or check out shoot me a email [here](mailto:pitt_bic@simplelogin.com).

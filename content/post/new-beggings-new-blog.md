Hey guys if you happen to be reading this at the time of publication: Happy New Years! If you are from the future how are your resolutions going? One of my  resolutions for this year is to simply write something daily. I decided that that would take the form of a blog as I already owned the domain so why not :smile:.

Things I post on here will range from musings to guides to rants, basically whatever I feel like writing that day. You may even get a recipe here and there. No matter what I decide to post I hope you find it informational, useful, or at least entertaining.
